# Perceptron-python
Implementing various perceptron models manually using numpy

Q1 is a simple single perceptron neuron for achiving one line in 2d sapce

Q2 is again a single perceptron but for a more complicated dataset

Q5 is a MLP model with backtracking using numpy for classifying Mnist dataset(mnsit dataset with .hdf5 format is needed beside code).
